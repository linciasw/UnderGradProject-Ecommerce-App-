        <h3>Hard Drive Buying Guide</h3>
            <p>So, you’re in the market for a new computer but aren’t exactly sure what device you want or need? </p>
            <p>
            What follows in this guide will help you have a strong understanding of what pre-built desktop PCs can offer you, as well as the multiple variations of these products. 
            <br>
            If you can live without the portability of a laptop or tablet, desktop PCs can provide you with more power as well as a different form of convenience. Compared to laptops, most pre-built PCs are more upgradable. Sure you can swap out hard drives, SSDs, and memory sticks on some laptops, but their CPUs and graphics are often soldered in, so your processing and graphics power will stay the same until your next purchase.
            Depending on the manufacturer, pre-built PCs can swap out most, if not all, components, including the graphics card, motherboard, and CPU. You do need to make sure to check back on your specifications though, whenever you’re changing out components.
            <br>
            Another great thing about desktops? You don’t need to worry about charging a battery. Just plug it into a viable outlet and you’re good to go. Fortunately, since you’re going with a pre-built instead of do-it-yourself, you also don’t initially have to worry about compatibility issues or making sure your PSU can handle your components.

            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>

            <p>
            Without an operating system, desktop PCs would just be immense paperweights with limited computing functions. A computer’s operating system is the overarching software that connects physical hardware and software applications together.
            Windows- Made by Microsoft, Windows is one of the world’s most popular operating systems with the most current version being Windows 10. If you’re a hardcore gamer, Windows should be your operating system of choice due to the fact that most of the latest PC games are only available on Windows. Like the majority of their releases, Microsoft’s Windows 10 comes in a Pro and Home edition. The main difference between these versions is that Pro comes with enterprise business features such as group policy management, remote desktop and other IT-related business support. It’s best to use the latest version of the OS but, but as of writing, the Windows 7 operating system is the minimum requirement for games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice or video-editing applications like Adobe Premiere.
            Mac- The other major entry at the forefront of popular operating systems for desktop PCs is Apple’s macOS. As of writing the most current version of Apple’s flagship operating system is macOS Mojave. The Mac platform houses a fair amount of support for the latest games, but not enough to be useful to hardcore PC gamers. Whereas Windows can be considered an open environment when it comes to modding or developing components and software, Apple’s system is closed. You have to abide by Apple’s rules, but the protection and privacy options you get with your Mac is top-notch. But this also means upgrades or self-repairs cannot be as easily executed on your Mac system. Nevertheless, millions of users love the features of macOS and Apple’s computers have become known as the machines of choice for artists and designers. Though prices may be high, the power and lifespan of the latest products generally match the initial investment.
            Chrome OS- A fairly new competitor, Google’s Chrome OS is an operating system based off Linux. Similar to their Android-based mobile operating systems, the latest Chrome OS desktop PCs utilize the Google Play Store for getting apps like Microsoft Office programs or streaming services like Netflix or YouTube.  Chrome OS desktop PCs can be highly cost-effective and useful for simple home entertainment, student work or small- to mid-sized businesses.
            Linux- This free, open-source operating system is highly efficient and effective for those interested in running server or large mainframe systems. Currently, one of the most-used distributions (distros) of Linux is called Ubuntu, but the beautiful thing about Linux is that users can choose from a number of publicly shared distributions and decide whichever one best fits their purposes.
