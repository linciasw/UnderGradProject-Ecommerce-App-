        <h3>Laptop Buying Guide</h3>
            <p>How To Choose A Laptop </p>
            <p>
            There’s never been a better time to buy a notebook PC. Today’s options are more powerful, more solidly built, longer lasting, and better looking than ever. Whether you want to run Windows 10, macOS, or Chrome OS, there’s likely a notebook that will meet your needs at a price you can afford.
            <br>
            Of course all of that variety makes choosing a notebook harder than ever. There are so many different makes and models to choose from that you need to do your research to make sure you’re getting just the right notebook for you.
            <br>
            That’s why we put this guide together, to provide an overview of the things you’ll want to consider before pulling out your credit card.

            <p>Form Factor</p>

            <p>
            Once upon a time, virtually all notebooks were of the clamshell variety, meaning you open the lid to reveal the display and uncover the keyboard located in the other half. That’s still a popular form factor, but it’s no longer the only option, and choosing between the alternatives is perhaps the biggest choice you’ll make.
            </p>

            <p>
            Clamshells - The clamshell notebook remains a popular choice, and for many brands it’s the only option available. Just about every notebook manufacturer produces clamshell versions, which tend to build in the most powerful components and come in the largest sizes, up to 17 inches and even larger.
            You’ll find clamshell notebooks running every available operating system today, including Windows 10, macOS, Chrome OS, and even Linux.

            Convertible 2-in-1s - An increasingly popular form factor is the convertible 2-in-1, which usually means a notebook that starts out like a clamshell but with a display that can be twisted all the way around until the notebook turns into a tablet. Thanks to their 360-degree hinges, convertible 2-in-1s provide considerable flexibility, typically offering four different usage options: clamshell, tent mode (an inverted “v”), presentation mode (where the keyboard is facing down, and the display faces the user), and tablet mode.
            Convertible 2-in-1 displays usually range in size from 11 inches to 15 inches, and they tend to be relatively thin and light. After all, nobody wants to hold a tablet that’s too thick or heavy. Some convertible 2-in-1s are equipped with fast central processing units (CPUs) and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), making them perform well in light gaming and content creation tasks.
            Also, many convertible 2-in-1s support active pens, and thus they work well with Windows 10 Ink that allows for writing and drawing on the display. Apple has yet to introduce a macOS 2-in-1 device, and so most run Windows 10. More recently, though, Chrome OS is becoming a popular 2-in-1 option as well.

            Detachable Tablet - Apple’s iPad kicked off the modern tablet market, but it didn’t take long for Windows manufacturers to join in. Microsoft started with its original Surface device, and today many companies are making Windows 10 tablets that are light and relatively powerful.
            Usually, tablets support detachable keyboards, which means that users can deploy them as traditional notebooks. Tablets are typically smaller than the other form factors, with most using displays between 10 and 13.3 inches. Because they’re so thin and light, they tend to use lower-powered CPUs and integrated graphics, but some offer entry-level discrete GPUs as well.
            As with convertible 2-in-1s, Apple doesn’t make a macOS tablet, and so your choices of operating system will be limited to Windows 10 and, recently, Chrome OS.
