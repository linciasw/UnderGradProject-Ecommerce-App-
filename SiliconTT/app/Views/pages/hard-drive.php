        <h3>How To Choose The Best Hard Drive for Desktop PCs?</h3>
            <p>Whether you’re building a PC for the first time or just looking to upgrade the storage components in your desktop PC, picking the right storage option is crucial for getting optimal performance in your system. Often overlooked as something that you need to buy “bigger” to be better, hard drives and storage devices have evolved a bit from their heavy-set historical past. At first, it may seem daunting to keep up with the different formats and technologies. What follows in this buying guide will help you choose the best storage for your desktop PC.</p>
            <p>
            What is internal desktop PC storage? As the name implies, internal desktop PC storage consists of components found within the chassis of any given system. This is true whether the device is a tower desktop or laptop. PC storage components install by a physical connection to either your computer motherboard’s SATA or PCI-E ports. By comparison, external storage consists of storage devices that come equipped with their own chassis.

            Like all things in computing, storage hardware comes in many different shapes and sizes. The types of storage drive we’re talking about today are specifically for common daily-computing as opposed to NAS (Network-Attached-Storage) or enterprise-level scenarios. At the end of the day, you are just storing stuff—but knowing each device’s intricacies and their technological history will give you a better understanding of how to implement them.

            Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
            </p>

            <p>
            The oldest device that we’ll be covering today, hard disk drives, more commonly referred to as hard drives, are mechanical components that use electromagnetism to store data. First introduced in the 1950s with IBM’s 305 RAMAC computer, the first magnetic hard disks changed the world by allowing users to finally access their saved information instantly. Unlike most things in the field of technology, hard drives have withstood the test of time as they are still relevant in today’s systems. But, exactly how does a hard drive work?
            <br>
            When you open a hard drive you’ll see a setup that looks very similar to a record player’s needle on a record. The basic difference comes in the form of an HDD’s applied magnetism. Without touching, the hard drive’s magnetic head (record player’s needle) on its actuator arm is able to access any part of the spinning platter that has also been coated with magnetic material.
            Despite being relatively old technology, hard drives have continued to be a popular storage option. This is thanks to years of solid performance and expanding storage space. But, HDDs do have their faults and limitations, and aren’t as fast or feature-rich as newer alternatives.

            Solid State Drives (SSDs)
            </p>

            <p>
            Due to their mechanical components, hard drives are a bit more prone to physical defects. They’re also not great at withstanding shock damage from being dropped or moved sharply. Because a hard drive has to spin extremely fast (up to 7,200 rotations per minute [RPM] for desktop-level products) there is a finite physical limitation to how fast your data can be accessed or moved.
            <br>
            SSDs are powered and effectively function by way of electronic circuits—and zero moving parts. If you remove the chassis of an SSD you’ll see something very similar to an electronic circuit board. Along with some of the main components found on most circuit boards, SSDs come equipped with flash memory chips (the SSD’s version of an HDD’s spinning disk) and a flash controller (the SSD’s take on the HDD’s magnetic actuator arm). With this format, you’re no longer limited to the physics of spinning and magnetism, but rather the quality and engineered-design of each circuit board. Simply put, this allows for better speed and reliability.
            Like hard drives, SSDs have evolved in many ways since their inception, including form factor. The base consumer-level SSDs for desktop PCS come in a hard-drive-like chassis—just much lighter and smaller, with the most common size today being 2.5”. Subsequently, the mSATA and M.2 form factors improve performance in an even smaller and lighter package.
